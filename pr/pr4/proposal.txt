I plan on working alone. My game is going to resemble a text based adventure,
but will make use of a rudimentary GUI. This will allow the player to select
options from various menu screens in order to undertake certain actions. The game
will take place on a spaceship (think 2001, Alien), and as such the player will
need to occasionally interact with the ship's onboard AI. The player will do so
through a terminal. Using a combination of this and navigating throughout the
maze-like ship, the player will attempt to solve a series of puzzles. There will
be no combat, and given the nature of the setting, the world will be contained
(ie., not open). I will be using the curses module from the python standard library
for menu creation and interaction.
