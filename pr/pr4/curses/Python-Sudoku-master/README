Sudoku is a Python game that uses the Curses module to control the display.

All information in: http://www.diogonuno.com

Currently doesn't run on Windows due to some curses based error (dunno) but runs on linux and mac. 
It just needs Python Curses Module to run. To play run "python sudoku.py" or just run the executable file with ./sudoku.py
