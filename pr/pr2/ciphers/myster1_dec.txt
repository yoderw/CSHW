IT TOOK TWO YEARS TO MAKE RETORTED THE TIME TRAVELLER THEN WHEN WE HAD ALL IMITATED THE ACTION OF THE MEDICAL MAN
HE SAID NOW I WANT YOU CLEARLY TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS LEVER BEING PRESSED OVER SENDS THE MACHINE GLIDING INTO THE
FUTURE AND THIS OTHER REVERSES THE MOTION THIS SADDLE REPRESENTS THE SEAT OF A TIME TRAVELLER PRESENTLY I AM GOING
TO PRESS THE LEVER AND OFF THE MACHINE WILL GO IT WILL VANISH PASS INTO FUTURE TIME AND DISAPPEAR HAVE A GOOD LOOK
AT THE THING LOOK AT THE TABLE TOO AND SATISFY YOURSELVES THERE IS NO TRICKERY I DONT WANT TO WASTE THIS MODEL AND
THEN BE TOLD IM A QUACK THERE WAS A MINUTES PAUSE PERHAPS THE PSYCHOLOGIST SEEMED ABOUT TO SPEAK TO ME BUT CHANGED
HIS MIND THEN THE TIME TRAVELLER PUT FORTH HIS FINGER TOWARDS THE LEVER NO HE SAID SUDDENLY LEND ME YOUR HAND AND
TURNING TO THE PSYCHOLOGIST HE TOOK THAT INDIVIDUALS HAND IN HIS OWN AND TOLD HIM TO PUT OUT HIS FOREFINGER SO THAT
IT WAS THE PSYCHOLOGIST HIMSELF WHO SENT FORTH THE MODEL TIME MACHINE ON ITS INTERMINABLE VOYAGE WE ALL SAW THE LEVER
TURN I AM ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THERE WAS NO TRICKERY THERE WAS A BREATH OF WIND AND THE LAMP FLAME JUMPED ONE OF THE
CANDLES ON THE MANTEL WAS BLOWN OUT AND THE LITTLE MACHINE SUDDENLY SWUNG ROUND BECAME INDISTINCT WAS SEEN AS A
GHOST FOR A SECOND PERHAPS AS AN EDDY OF FAINTLY GLITTERING BRASS AND IVORY AND IT WAS GONE VANISHED SAVE FOR THE
LAMP THE TABLE WAS BARE
